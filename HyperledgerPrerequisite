Hyperledger Fabric:
Once pre-requisites are in place, proceed to -> https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html  to get fabric images on local.
Ignore notes for Windows as we are not setting up fabric directly on Windows OS, we will be setting up fabric network on Ubuntu (either as host or VM) / Mac.

To test:
cd fabric-samples/first-network
./byfn.sh generate
./byfn.sh up
